	abstract = {The Bioconductor project has created many useful data abstractions for analysing high-throughput genomics experiments. However, there is a cognitive load placed on a user in learning a data abstraction and understanding its appropriate use. Throughout a standard workflow, a user must navigate and know many of these abstractions to perform an genomic analysis task, when a single data abstraction, a GRanges object will suffice. The GRanges class naturally represent genomic intervals and their associated measurements. By recognising that the GRanges class follows {\textquoteright}tidy{\textquoteright} data principles we have created a grammar of genomic data transformation. The grammar defines verbs for performing actions on and between genomic interval data. It provides a principled way of performing common genomic data analysis tasks through a coherent interface to existing Bioconductor infrastructure, resulting in human readable analysis workflows. We have implemented this grammar as a Bioconductor/R package called \&lt;tt\&gt;plyranges\&lt;/tt\&gt;.},

  title    = {Usability Analysis of Visual Programming Environments: A
              `Cognitive Dimensions' Framework},
  author   = {Green, TRG and Petre, M},
  abstract = {The cognitive dimensions framework is a broad-brush evaluation
              technique for interactive devices and for non-interactive
              notations. It sets out a small vocabulary of terms designed to
              capture the cognitively-relevant aspects of structure, and shows
              how they can be traded off against each other. The purpose of
              this paper is to propose the framework as an evaluation technique
              for visual programming environments. We apply it to two
              commercially-available dataflow languages (with further examples
              from other systems) and conclude that it is effective and
              insightful; other HCI-based evaluation techniques focus on
              different aspects and would make good complements. Insofar as the
              examples we used are representative, current VPLs are successful
              in achieving a good `closeness of match', but designers need to
              consider the `viscosity ' (resistance to local change) and the
              `secondary notation' (possibility of conveying extra meaning by
              choice of layout, colour, etc.).},

  abstract    = {MOTIVATION: Testing for correlations between different sets of
                 genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research.
                 However, searching for overlaps between features with existing
                 web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that
                 are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies.
                 Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex
                 questions of these data in an efficient manner. RESULTS: This
                 article introduces a new software suite for the comparison,
                 manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser
                 Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format.
                 BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments
                 in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are
                 extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large
                 datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both
                 public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be
                 combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX
                 commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as
                 pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large
                 genomic datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: BEDTools
                 was written in C++. Source code and a comprehensive user

  title    = {Tidy Data},
  author   = {Wickham, Hadley},
  abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready
              for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make
              data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper
              tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data
              tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and
              visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a
              column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational
              unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy
              datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal
              with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes
              it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that
              both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a
              consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated
              with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

  abstract    = {The reference human genome sequence set the stage for studies
                 of genetic variation and its association with human disease,
                 but epigenomic studies lack a similar reference. To address
                 this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated
                 the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary
                 cells and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis
                 of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the
                 programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA
                 accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We
                 establish global maps of regulatory elements, define
                 regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely
                 activators and repressors. We show that disease- and
                 trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in
                 tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically
                 relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a
                 resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human
                 disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of
                 epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation,
                 cellular differentiation and human disease.},
