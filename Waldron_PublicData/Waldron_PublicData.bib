  abstract = "UNLABELLED: Microarray technology has become a standard molecular
              biology tool. Experimental data have been generated on a huge
              number of organisms, tissue types, treatment conditions and
              disease states. The Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al.,
              2005), developed by the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI)
              at the National Institutes of Health is a repository of nearly
              140,000 gene expression experiments. The BioConductor project
              (Gentleman et al., 2004) is an open-source and open-development
              software project built in the R statistical programming
              environment (R Development core Team, 2005) for the analysis and
              comprehension of genomic data. The tools contained in the
              BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for
              the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a
              software tool that allows access to the wealth of information
              within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the
              formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses
              labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery,
              effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor.
              Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new
              analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and
              bioinformatic tools. Facilitating analyses and meta-analyses of
              microarray data will increase the efficiency with which
              biologically important conclusions can be drawn from published
              genomic data.\textbackslashn\textbackslashnAVAILABILITY: GEOquery
              is available as part of the BioConductor project.",
