## GEOquery

[@Sean2007-cv]

The NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) serves as a public repository for a wide range of high-throughput experimental data. These data include single and dual channel microarray-based experiments measuring mRNA, genomic DNA, and protein abundance, as well as non-array techniques such as serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), mass spectrometry proteomic data, and high-throughput sequencing data.
The `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("GEOquery")` package [@Sean2007-cv] forms a bridge between this public repository and the analysis capabilities
in Bioconductor.

### Overview of GEO

At the most basic level of organization of GEO, there are four basic entity types.  The first three (Sample, Platform, and Series) are supplied by users; the fourth, the dataset, is compiled and curated by GEO staff from the user-submitted data. See [the GEO home page](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) for more information.

#### Platforms

A Platform record describes the list of elements on the array (e.g., cDNAs, oligonucleotide probesets, ORFs, antibodies) or the list of elements that may be detected and quantified in that experiment (e.g., SAGE tags, peptides). Each Platform record is assigned a unique and stable GEO accession number (GPLxxx). A Platform may reference many Samples that have been submitted by multiple submitters.

#### Samples

A Sample record describes the conditions under which an individual Sample was handled, the manipulations it underwent, and the abundance measurement of each element derived from it. Each Sample record is assigned a unique and stable GEO accession number (GSMxxx). A Sample entity must reference only one Platform and may be included in multiple Series.

#### Series

A Series record defines a set of related Samples considered to be part of a group, how the Samples are related, and if and how they are ordered. A Series provides a focal point and description of the experiment as a whole. Series records may also contain tables describing extracted data, summary conclusions, or analyses. Each Series record is assigned a unique and stable GEO accession number (GSExxx).  Series records are available in a couple of formats which are handled by GEOquery independently.  The smaller and new GSEMatrix files are quite fast to parse; a simple flag is used by GEOquery to choose to use GSEMatrix files (see below).

#### Datasets

GEO DataSets (GDSxxx) are curated sets of GEO Sample data. There are hundreds of GEO datasets available, but GEO discontinued creating 
GDS records several years ago. We mention them here for completeness only.

### Getting Started using GEOquery

Getting data from GEO is really quite easy.  There is only one command that is needed, `getGEO`.  This one function interprets its input to determine how to get the data from GEO and then parse the data into useful R data structures.


```{r loadLibrary20, message=FALSE}
library(GEOquery)
```

With the library loaded, we are free to access any GEO accession. 

### Use case: MDS plot of cancer data

The data we are going to access are from [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-17-0461). 

> Background: The tumor microenvironment is an important factor in cancer immunotherapy response. To further understand how a tumor affects the local immune system, we analyzed immune gene expression differences between matching normal and tumor tissue.Methods: We analyzed public and new gene expression data from solid cancers and isolated immune cell populations. We also determined the correlation between CD8, FoxP3 IHC, and our gene signatures.Results: We observed that regulatory T cells (Tregs) were one of the main drivers of immune gene expression differences between normal and tumor tissue. A tumor-specific CD8 signature was slightly lower in tumor tissue compared with normal of most (12 of 16) cancers, whereas a Treg signature was higher in tumor tissue of all cancers except liver. Clustering by Treg signature found two groups in colorectal cancer datasets. The high Treg cluster had more samples that were consensus molecular subtype 1/4, right-sided, and microsatellite-instable, compared with the low Treg cluster. Finally, we found that the correlation between signature and IHC was low in our small dataset, but samples in the high Treg cluster had significantly more CD8+ and FoxP3+ cells compared with the low Treg cluster.Conclusions: Treg gene expression is highly indicative of the overall tumor immune environment.Impact: In comparison with the consensus molecular subtype and microsatellite status, the Treg signature identifies more colorectal tumors with high immune activation that may benefit from cancer immunotherapy. 

In this little exercise, we will:

1. Access public omics data using the GEOquery package
2. Convert the public omics data to a `SummarizedExperiment` object.
3. Perform a simple unsupervised analysis to visualize these public data.

Use the [GEOquery] package to fetch data about [GSE103512].

```{r geoquery10, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE}
gse = getGEO("GSE103512")[[1]]
```

Note that `getGEO`, when used to retrieve *GSE* records, returns a list. The members of the list each represent
one *GEO Platform*, since each *GSE* record can contain multiple related datasets (eg., gene expression and DNA methylation). 
In this case, the list is of length one, but it is still necessary to grab the first elment. 

The first step--a detail--is to convert from the older Bioconductor data structure (GEOquery was written in 2007), the `ExpressionSet`, to the newer `SummarizedExperiment`. One line suffices.

```{r convertToSE, message=FALSE}
library(SummarizedExperiment)
se = as(gse, "SummarizedExperiment")
```

Examine two variables of interest, cancer type and tumor/normal status. 

```{r geoquery20,echo=TRUE,cache=TRUE}
with(colData(se),table(`cancer.type.ch1`,`normal.ch1`))
```

Filter gene expression by variance to find most informative genes.

```{r sds,cache=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
sds = apply(assay(se, 'exprs'),1,sd)
dat = assay(se, 'exprs')[order(sds,decreasing = TRUE)[1:500],]
```

Perform [multidimensional scaling] and prepare for plotting. We will be using ggplot2, so
we need to make a data.frame before plotting. 

```{r mds,echo=TRUE,cache=TRUE}
mdsvals = cmdscale(dist(t(dat)))
mdsvals = as.data.frame(mdsvals)
mdsvals$Type=factor(colData(se)[,'cancer.type.ch1'])
mdsvals$Normal = factor(colData(se)[,'normal.ch1'])
head(mdsvals)
```

And do the plot.

```{r mdsplot,echo=TRUE,fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mdsvals, aes(x=V1,y=V2,shape=Normal,color=Type)) + 
    geom_point( alpha=0.6) + theme(text=element_text(size = 18))
```

### Accessing Raw Data from GEO

NCBI GEO accepts (but has not always required) raw data such as .CEL files, .CDF files, images, etc. It is also not uncommon for some RNA-seq or other sequencing datasets to supply *only* raw data (with accompanying sample information, of course), necessitating  Sometimes, it is useful to get quick access to such data.  A single function, `getGEOSuppFiles`, can take as an argument a GEO accession and will download all the raw data associate with that accession.  By default, the function will create a directory in the current working directory to store the raw data for the chosen GEO accession.

## GenomicDataCommons

From the [Genomic Data Commons (GDC) website](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/about-gdc):

> The National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) is
a data sharing platform that promotes precision medicine in
oncology. It is not just a database or a tool; it is an expandable
knowledge network supporting the import and standardization of genomic
and clinical data from cancer research programs.
> The GDC contains NCI-generated data from some of the largest and most
comprehensive cancer genomic datasets, including The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) and Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate
Effective Therapies (TARGET). For the first time, these datasets have
been harmonized using a common set of bioinformatics pipelines, so
that the data can be directly compared.
> As a growing knowledge system for cancer, the GDC also enables
researchers to submit data, and harmonizes these data for import into
the GDC. As more researchers add clinical and genomic data to the GDC,
it will become an even more powerful tool for making discoveries about
the molecular basis of cancer that may lead to better care for
patients.

The
[data model for the GDC is complex](https://gdc.cancer.gov/developers/gdc-data-model/gdc-data-model-components),
but it worth a quick overview and a graphical representation is included here. 

![The data model is encoded as a
so-called property graph. Nodes represent entities such as Projects,
Cases, Diagnoses, Files (various kinds), and Annotations. The
relationships between these entities are maintained as edges.  Both
nodes and edges may have Properties that supply instance details. ](Waldron_PublicData/all_nodes_040318.png)

 The
GDC API exposes these nodes and edges in a somewhat simplified set
of
[RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) endpoints.

### Quickstart

This quickstart section is just meant to show basic
functionality. More details of functionality are included further on
in this vignette and in function-specific help.

To report bugs or problems, either
[submit a new issue](https://github.com/Bioconductor/GenomicDataCommons/issues)
or submit a `bug.report(package='GenomicDataCommons')` from within R (which will
redirect you to the new issue on GitHub).

#### Installation

Installation of the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("GenomicDataCommons")` package is
identical to installation of other Bioconductor packages.


```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('BiocManager')
BiocManager::install('GenomicDataCommons')
```

After installation, load the library in order to use it.

```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
library(GenomicDataCommons)
```

#### Check connectivity and status

The `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("GenomicDataCommons")` package relies on having network
connectivity. In addition, the NCI GDC API must also be operational
and not under maintenance. Checking `status` can be used to check this
connectivity and functionality.

```{r statusQS}
GenomicDataCommons::status()
```

#### Find data

The following code builds a `manifest` that can be used to guide the
download of raw data. Here, filtering finds gene expression files
quantified as raw counts using `HTSeq` from ovarian cancer patients.

```{r manifest}
ge_manifest = files() %>%
    filter( ~ cases.project.project_id == 'TCGA-OV' &
                type == 'gene_expression' &
                analysis.workflow_type == 'HTSeq - Counts') %>%
    manifest()
```

#### Download data

After  the `r nrow(ge_manifest)` gene expression files
specified in the query above. Using multiple processes to do the download very
significantly speeds up the transfer in many cases.  On a standard 1Gb
connection, the following completes in about 30 seconds. The first time the 
data are downloaded, R will ask to create a cache directory (see `?gdc_cache`
for details of setting and interacting with the cache). Resulting
downloaded files will be stored in the cache directory. Future access to 
the same files will be directly from the cache, alleviating multiple downloads.

```{r downloadQS}
fnames = lapply(ge_manifest$id[1:20],gdcdata)
```

If the download had included controlled-access data, the download above would
have needed to include a `token`.  Details are available in
[the authentication section below](#authentication).

#### Metadata queries

The `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("GenomicDataCommons")` can access the significant clinical, demographic, biospecimen, and annotation information contained in the NCI GDC. 

```{r metadataQS}
expands = c("diagnoses","annotations",
             "demographic","exposures")
projResults = projects() %>%
    results(size=10)
str(projResults,list.len=5)
names(projResults)
# or listviewer::jsonedit(clinResults)
```

### Basic design

This package design is meant to have some similarities to the "hadleyverse"
approach of dplyr. Roughly, the functionality for finding and accessing files
and metadata can be divided into:

1. Simple query constructors based on GDC API endpoints.
2. A set of verbs that when applied, adjust filtering, field selection, and
faceting (fields for aggregation) and result in a new query object (an
endomorphism)
3. A set of verbs that take a query and return results from the GDC

In addition, there are exhiliary functions for asking the GDC API for
information about available and default fields, slicing BAM files, and
downloading actual data files.  Here is an overview of functionality[^10].


- Creating a query
    - `projects()`
    - `cases()`
    - `files()`
    - `annotations()`

    - `mapping()`
    - `available_fields()`
    - `default_fields()`
    - `grep_fields()`
    - `field_picker()`
    - `available_values()`
    - `available_expand()`
- Executing an API call to retrieve query results
    - `results()`
    - `count()`
    - `response()`
- Raw data file downloads
    - `gdcdata()`
    - `transfer()`
    - `gdc_client()`
- Summarizing and aggregating field values (faceting)
    - `aggregations()`
- Authentication
    - `gdc_token()`
- BAM file slicing
    - `slicing()`

[^10]: See individual function and methods documentation for specific details.


### Usage

There are two main classes of operations when working with the NCI GDC.

1. [Querying metadata and finding data files](#querying-metadata) (e.g., finding
all gene expression quantifications data files for all colon cancer patients).
2. [Transferring raw or processed data](#datafile-access-and-download) from the
GDC to another computer (e.g., downloading raw or processed data)

Both classes of operation are reviewed in detail in the following sections.

## Querying metadata

Vast amounts of metadata about cases (patients, basically), files, projects, and
so-called annotations are available via the NCI GDC API. Typically, one will
want to query metadata to either focus in on a set of files for download or
transfer *or* to perform so-called aggregations (pivot-tables, facets, similar
to the R `table()` functionality).

Querying metadata starts with [creating a "blank" query](#creating-a-query). One
will often then want to [`filter`](#filtering) the query to limit results prior
to [retrieving results](#retrieving-results). The GenomicDataCommons package has
[helper functions for listing fields](#fields-and-values) that are available for
filtering.

In addition to fetching results, the GDC API allows
[faceting, or aggregating,](#facets-and-aggregation), useful for compiling
reports, generating dashboards, or building user interfaces to GDC data (see GDC
web query interface for a non-R-based example).

#### Creating a query

The `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("GenomicDataCommons")` package accesses the *same*
API as the *GDC* website. Therefore, a useful approach, particularly for
beginning users is to examine the filters available on the 
[GDC repository pages](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository)
to find appropriate filtering criteria. From there, converting those checkboxes
to a GenomicDataCommons `query()` is relatively straightforward. Note that only 
a small subset of the `available_fields()` are available by default on the website.

![A screenshot of an example query of the GDC repository portal.](Waldron_PublicData/gdc_filtering.png)

A query of the GDC starts its life in R. Queries follow the four metadata
endpoints available at the GDC.  In particular, there are four convenience
functions that each create `GDCQuery` objects (actually, specific subclasses of
`GDCQuery`):

- `projects()`
- `cases()`
- `files()`
- `annotations()`

```{r projectquery}
pquery = projects()
```

The `pquery` object is now an object of (S3) class, `GDCQuery` (and
`gdc_projects` and `list`). The object contains the following elements:

- fields: This is a character vector of the fields that will be returned when we
[retrieve data](#retrieving-results). If no fields are specified to, for
example, the `projects()` function, the default fields from the GDC are used
(see `default_fields()`)
- filters: This will contain results after calling the
[`filter()` method](#filtering) and will be used to filter results on
[retrieval](#retrieving-results).
- facets: A character vector of field names that will be used for
[aggregating data](#facets-and-aggregation) in a call to `aggregations()`.
- archive: One of either "default" or ["legacy"](https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/legacy-archive/).
- token: A character(1) token from the GDC. See
[the authentication section](#authentication) for details, but note that, in
general, the token is not necessary for metadata query and retrieval, only for
actual data download.

Looking at the actual object (get used to using `str()`!), note that the query
contains no results.

```{r pquery}
str(pquery)
```
#### Retrieving results

[[ GDC pagination documentation ]](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/API/Users_Guide/Search_and_Retrieval/#size-and-from)

[[ GDC sorting documentation ]](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/API/Users_Guide/Search_and_Retrieval/#sort)

With a query object available, the next step is to retrieve results from the
GDC. The GenomicDataCommons package.  The most basic type of results we can get
is a simple `count()` of records available that satisfy the filter criteria.
Note that we have not set any filters, so a `count()` here will represent all
the project records publicly available at the GDC in the "default" archive"

```{r pquerycount}
pcount = count(pquery)
# or
pcount = pquery %>% count()
pcount
```

The `results()` method will fetch actual results.

```{r pqueryresults}
presults = pquery %>% results()
```
These results are
returned from the GDC in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) format and
converted into a (potentially nested) list in R. The `str()` method is useful
for taking a quick glimpse of the data.

```{r presultsstr}
str(presults)
```

A default of only 10 records are returned. We can use the `size` and `from`
arguments to `results()` to either page through results or to change the number
of results. Finally, there is a convenience method, `results_all()` that will
simply fetch all the available results given a query. Note that `results_all()`
may take a long time and return HUGE result sets if not used carefully. Use of a
combination of `count()` and `results()` to get a sense of the expected data
size is probably warranted before calling `results_all()`

```{r presultsall}
length(ids(presults))
presults = pquery %>% results_all()
length(ids(presults))
# includes all records
length(ids(presults)) == count(pquery)
```

Extracting subsets of
results or manipulating the results into a more conventional R data
structure is not easily generalizable.  However,
the
[purrr](https://github.com/hadley/purrr),
[rlist](https://renkun.me/rlist/),
and [data.tree](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.tree/vignettes/data.tree.html) packages
are all potentially of interest for manipulating complex, nested list
structures. For viewing the results in an interactive viewer, consider the
[listviewer](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/listviewer) package.


#### Fields and Values

[[ GDC `fields` documentation ]](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/API/Users_Guide/Search_and_Retrieval/#fields)

Central to querying and retrieving data from the GDC is the ability to specify
which fields to return, filtering by fields and values, and faceting or
aggregating. The GenomicDataCommons package includes two simple functions,
`available_fields()` and `default_fields()`. Each can operate on a character(1)
endpoint name ("cases", "files", "annotations", or "projects") or a `GDCQuery`
object.

```{r defaultfields}
default_fields('files')
# The number of fields available for files endpoint
length(available_fields('files'))
# The first few fields available for files endpoint
head(available_fields('files'))
```

The fields to be returned by a query can be specified following a similar
paradigm to that of the dplyr package. The `select()` function is a verb that
resets the fields slot of a `GDCQuery`; note that this is not quite analogous to
the dplyr `select()` verb that limits from already-present fields. We
*completely replace* the fields when using `select()` on a `GDCQuery`.

```{r selectexample}
# Default fields here
qcases = cases()
qcases$fields
# set up query to use ALL available fields
# Note that checking of fields is done by select()
qcases = cases() %>% GenomicDataCommons::select(available_fields('cases'))
head(qcases$fields)
```

Finding fields of interest is such a common operation that the
GenomicDataCommons includes the `grep_fields()` function and the
`field_picker()` widget. See the appropriate help pages for details.

#### Facets and aggregation

[[ GDC `facet` documentation ]](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/API/Users_Guide/Search_and_Retrieval/#facets)

The GDC API offers a feature known as aggregation or faceting. By
specifying one or more fields (of appropriate type), the GDC can
return to us a count of the number of records matching each potential
value. This is similar to the R `table` method. Multiple fields can be
returned at once, but the GDC API does not have a cross-tabulation
feature; all aggregations are only on one field at a time. Results of
`aggregation()` calls come back as a list of data.frames (actually,
tibbles).

```{r aggexample}
# total number of files of a specific type
res = files() %>% facet(c('type','data_type')) %>% aggregations()
res$type
```

Using `aggregations()` is an also easy way to learn the contents of individual
fields and forms the basis for faceted search pages.

#### Filtering

[[ GDC `filtering` documentation ]](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/API/Users_Guide/Search_and_Retrieval/#filters-specifying-the-query)

The GenomicDataCommons package uses a form of non-standard evaluation to specify
R-like queries that are then translated into an R list. That R list is, upon
calling a method that fetches results from the GDC API, translated into the
appropriate JSON string. The R expression uses the formula interface as
suggested by Hadley Wickham in his [vignette on non-standard evaluation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/nse.html)

> It’s best to use a formula because a formula captures both the expression to
evaluate and the environment where the evaluation occurs. This is important if
the expression is a mixture of variables in a data frame and objects in the
local environment [for example].

For the user, these details will not be too important except to note that a
filter expression must begin with a "~".

```{r allfilesunfiltered}
qfiles = files()
qfiles %>% count() # all files
```
To limit the file type, we can refer back to the
[section on faceting](#facets-and-aggregation) to see the possible values for
the file field "type". For example, to filter file results to only
"gene_expression" files, we simply specify a filter.

```{r onlyGeneExpression}
qfiles = files() %>% filter(~ type == 'gene_expression')
# here is what the filter looks like after translation
str(get_filter(qfiles))
```

What if we want to create a filter based on the project ('TCGA-OVCA', for
example)? Well, we have a couple of possible ways to discover available fields.
The first is based on base R functionality and some intuition.

```{r filtAvailFields}
grep('pro',available_fields('files'),value=TRUE)
```

Interestingly, the project information is "nested" inside the case. We don't
need to know that detail other than to know that we now have a few potential
guesses for where our information might be in the files records.  We need to
know where because we need to construct the appropriate filter.

```{r filtProgramID}
files() %>% facet('cases.project.project_id') %>% aggregations()
```

We note that `cases.project.project_id` looks like it is a good fit. We also
note that `TCGA-OV` is the correct project_id, not `TCGA-OVCA`. Note that
*unlike with dplyr and friends, the `filter()` method here **replaces** the
filter and does not build on any previous filters*.

```{r filtfinal}
qfiles = files() %>%
    filter( ~ cases.project.project_id == 'TCGA-OV' & type == 'gene_expression')
str(get_filter(qfiles))
qfiles %>% count()
```

Asking for a `count()` of results given these new filter criteria gives `r
qfiles %>% count()` results.  Generating a manifest for bulk downloads is as
simple as asking for the manifest from the current query.

```{r filtAndManifest}
manifest_df = qfiles %>% manifest()
head(manifest_df)
```

Note that we might still not be quite there. Looking at filenames, there are
suspiciously named files that might include "FPKM", "FPKM-UQ", or "counts".
Another round of `grep` and `available_fields`, looking for "type" turned up
that the field "analysis.workflow_type" has the appropriate filter criteria.

```{r filterForHTSeqCounts}
qfiles = files() %>% filter( ~ cases.project.project_id == 'TCGA-OV' &
                            type == 'gene_expression' &
                            analysis.workflow_type == 'HTSeq - Counts')
manifest_df = qfiles %>% manifest()
nrow(manifest_df)
```

The GDC Data Transfer Tool can be used (from R, `transfer()` or from the
command-line) to orchestrate high-performance, restartable transfers of all the
files in the manifest. See [the bulk downloads section](bulk-downloads) for
details.


### Authentication

[[ GDC authentication documentation ]](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/API/Users_Guide/Search_and_Retrieval/#facets)

The GDC offers both "controlled-access" and "open" data. As of this
writing, only data stored as files is "controlled-access"; that is,
metadata accessible via the GDC is all "open" data and some files are
"open" and some are "controlled-access". Controlled-access data are
only available
after
[going through the process of obtaining access.](https://gdc.cancer.gov/access-data/obtaining-access-controlled-data)

After controlled-access to one or more datasets has been granted,
logging into the GDC web portal will allow you
to
[access a GDC authentication token](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/Authentication/#gdc-authentication-tokens),
which can be downloaded and then used to access available
controlled-access data via the GenomicDataCommons package.

The GenomicDataCommons uses authentication tokens only for downloading
data (see `transfer` and `gdcdata` documentation). The package
includes a helper function, `gdc_token`, that looks for the token to
be stored in one of three ways (resolved in this order):

1. As a string stored in the environment variable, `GDC_TOKEN`
2. As a file, stored in the file named by the environment variable,
   `GDC_TOKEN_FILE`
3. In a file in the user home directory, called `.gdc_token`

As a concrete example:

```{r authenNoRun, eval=FALSE}
token = gdc_token()
transfer(...,token=token)
# or
transfer(...,token=get_token())
```


### Datafile access and download

The `gdcdata` function takes a character vector of one or more file
ids. A simple way of producing such a vector is to produce a
`manifest` data frame and then pass in the first column, which will
contain file ids.

```{r singlefileDL}
fnames = gdcdata(manifest_df$id[1:2],progress=FALSE)

```

Note that for controlled-access data, a
GDC [authentication token](#authentication) is required. Using the
`BiocParallel` package may be useful for downloading in parallel,
particularly for large numbers of smallish files.

The bulk download functionality is only efficient (as of v1.2.0 of the
GDC Data Transfer Tool) for relatively large files, so use this
approach only when transferring BAM files or larger VCF files, for
example. Otherwise, consider using the approach shown above, perhaps
in parallel.

```{r bulkDL}
fnames = gdcdata(manifest_df$id[3:10], access_method = 'client')
```



## Sequence Read Archive


The SRAdbV2 package is currently available from [GitHub] and is under
active development. Either the `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("devtools")` package or the
`r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("BiocManager")` package can be used for easy installation.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('BiocManager')
BiocManager::install('seandavi/SRAdbV2')
```

[GitHub]: https://github.com/seandavi/SRAdbV2


### Usage

#### Loading the library

```{r cache=FALSE}
library(SRAdbV2)
```

#### The Omicidx 

The entrypoint for using the SRAdbV2 system is the `Omicidx`, an [R6 class].
To start, create a new instance of the class. 

[R6 class]: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R6/vignettes/Introduction.html

```{r cache=FALSE}
oidx = Omicidx$new()
```

Typing `oidx$` and then `TAB` will give possible completions. Note the "search" 
completion. 

#### Queries

Once an instance of `Omicidx` is created (here we will call the instance `oidx`), 
search capabilities are available via `oidx$search()`. The one interesting
parameter is the `q` parameter. This parameter takes a string formatted as a Lucene query
string. See below for [Query syntax]. 

```{r cache=FALSE}
query=paste(
  paste0('sample_taxon_id:', 10116),
  'AND experiment_library_strategy:"rna seq"',
  'AND experiment_library_source:transcriptomic',
  'AND experiment_platform:illumina')
z = oidx$search(q=query,entity='full',size=100L)
```

The `entity` parameter is one of the SRA entity types available via the API. 
The `size` parameter is the number of records that will be returned in each "chunk".

#### Fetching results

Because result sets can be large, we have a special method that allows us to 
"scroll" through the results or to simply get them *en bloc*. The first step
for result retrieval, then, is to get a `Scroller`. 

```{r cache=FALSE}
s = z$scroll()
s
```

Methods such as `s$count` allow introspection into the available number of
results, in this case, `r s$count` records.

The `Scroller` provides two different approaches to accessing the resulting data.

##### Collating entire result sets

The first approach to getting results of a query back into R is the
most convenient, but for large result sets, the entire dataset is
loaded into memory and may take significant time if network
connections are slow.


```{r cache=FALSE}
# for VERY large result sets, this may take
# quite a bit of time and/or memory. An
# alternative is to use s$chunk() to retrieve
# one batch of records at a time and process
# incrementally.
res = s$collate(limit = 1000)
head(res)
```

Note that the scroller now reports that it has fetched (`s$fetched`) `r s$fetched` records.

To reuse a `Scroller`, we must reset it first.

```{r cache=FALSE}
s$reset()
s
```

##### Yielding chunks

The second approach is to iterate through results using the `yield`
method. This approach allows the user to perform processing on chunks
of data as they arrive in R.

```{r cache=FALSE}
j = 0
## fetch only 500 records, but
## `yield` will return NULL
## after ALL records have been fetched
while(s$fetched < 500) {
    res = s$yield()
    # do something interesting with `res` here if you like
    j = j + 1
    message(sprintf('total of %d fetched records, loop iteration # %d', s$fetched, j))
}
```

The `Scroller` also has a `has_next()` method that will report `TRUE` if the 
result set has not been fully fetched. Using the `reset()` method will move the 
cursor back to the beginning of the result set.

### Query syntax


#### Terms

A query is broken up into terms and operators. There are two types of terms: Single Terms and Phrases. A Single Term is a single word such as "test" or "hello". A Phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as "hello dolly". Multiple terms can be combined together with Boolean operators to form a more complex query (see below).

#### Fields

Queries support fielded data. When performing a search you can either specify a field, or use the default field. The field names and default field is implementation specific. You can search any field by typing the field name followed by a colon ":" and then the term you are looking for. As an example, let's assume a Lucene index contains two fields, title and abstract. If you want to find the document entitled "The Right Way" which contains the text "don't go this way" in the abstract, you can enter:

```
title:"The Right Way" AND abstract:go
```

or

Note: The field is only valid for the term that it directly precedes, so the query

```
title:Do it right
```

will only find "Do" in the title field. It will find "it" and "right" in any other fields.

#### Wildcard Searches

Lucene supports single and multiple character wildcard searches within single terms (not within phrase queries). To perform a single character wildcard search use the "?" symbol. To perform a multiple character wildcard search use the "*" symbol. The single character wildcard search looks for terms that match that with the single character replaced. For example, to search for "text" or "test" you can use the search:

```
te?t
```

Multiple character wildcard searches looks for 0 or more characters. For example, to search for test, tests or tester, you can use the search:

```
test*
```

You can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term.

```
te*t
```

Note: You cannot use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search.

#### Fuzzy Searches

Lucene supports fuzzy searches based on the Levenshtein Distance, or Edit Distance algorithm. To do a fuzzy search use the tilde, "~", symbol at the end of a Single word Term. For example to search for a term similar in spelling to "roam" use the fuzzy search:

```
roam~
```


This search will find terms like foam and roams.

Starting with Lucene 1.9 an additional (optional) parameter can specify the required similarity. The value is between 0 and 1, with a value closer to 1 only terms with a higher similarity will be matched. For example:


```
roam~0.8
```

The default that is used if the parameter is not given is 0.5.

#### Proximity Searches

Lucene supports finding words are a within a specific distance away. To do a proximity search use the tilde, "~", symbol at the end of a Phrase. For example to search for a "apache" and "jakarta" within 10 words of each other in a document use the search:

```
"jakarta apache"~10
```

#### Range Searches

Range Queries allow one to match documents whose field(s) values are between the lower and upper bound specified by the Range Query. Range Queries can be inclusive or exclusive of the upper and lower bounds. Sorting is done lexicographically.

```
mod_date:[20020101 TO 20030101]
```

This will find documents whose mod_date fields have values between 20020101 and 20030101, inclusive. Note that Range Queries are not reserved for date fields. You could also use range queries with non-date fields:

```
title:{Aida TO Carmen}
```

This will find all documents whose titles are between Aida and Carmen, but not including Aida and Carmen. Inclusive range queries are denoted by square brackets. Exclusive range queries are denoted by curly brackets.

#### Boolean Operators

Boolean operators allow terms to be combined through logic operators. Lucene supports AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-" as Boolean operators(Note: Boolean operators must be ALL CAPS).

##### OR

The OR operator is the default conjunction operator. This means that if there is no Boolean operator between two terms, the OR operator is used. The OR operator links two terms and finds a matching document if either of the terms exist in a document. This is equivalent to a union using sets. The symbol || can be used in place of the word OR.

To search for documents that contain either "jakarta apache" or just "jakarta" use the query:

```
"jakarta apache" jakarta
```

or

```
"jakarta apache" OR jakarta
```

The AND operator matches documents where both terms exist anywhere in the text of a single document. This is equivalent to an intersection using sets. The symbol && can be used in place of the word AND. To search for documents that contain "jakarta apache" and "Apache Lucene" use the query:

"jakarta apache" AND "Apache Lucene"


##### +

The "+" or required operator requires that the term after the "+" symbol exist somewhere in a the field of a single document. To search for documents that must contain "jakarta" and may contain "lucene" use the query:

```
+jakarta lucene
```

##### NOT

The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term after NOT. This is equivalent to a difference using sets. The symbol ! can be used in place of the word NOT. To search for documents that contain "jakarta apache" but not "Apache Lucene" use the query:

```
"jakarta apache" NOT "Apache Lucene"
```

Note: The NOT operator cannot be used with just one term. For example, the following search will return no results:

```
NOT "jakarta apache"
```

##### -

The "-" or prohibit operator excludes documents that contain the term after the "-" symbol. To search for documents that contain "jakarta apache" but not "Apache Lucene" use the query:

```
"jakarta apache" -"Apache Lucene"
```

#### Grouping

Lucene supports using parentheses to group clauses to form sub queries. This can be very useful if you want to control the boolean logic for a query. To search for either "jakarta" or "apache" and "website" use the query:

```
(jakarta OR apache) AND website
```

This eliminates any confusion and makes sure you that website must exist and either term jakarta or apache may exist.

Lucene supports using parentheses to group multiple clauses to a single field.

To search for a title that contains both the word "return" and the phrase "pink panther" use the query:

```
title:(+return +"pink panther")
```

#### Escaping Special Characters
Lucene supports escaping special characters that are part of the query syntax. The current list special characters are

```
+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \
```

To escape these character use the \ before the character. For example to search for (1+1):2 use the query:

```
\(1\+1\)\:2
```

### Using the raw API without R/Bioconductor

The SRAdbV2 is a client to a high-performance web-based API. As
such, the web API is perfectly usable from either a simple test page, 
accessible here:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sra_browse_API()
```

The web-based API provides a useful interface for experiment
with queries. It also returns URLs associated with the example
queries, facilitating querying with other tools like `curl` or
`wget`

The API is described using the OpenAPI standard, also known as 
[Swagger](https://swagger.io/). Tooling exists to quickly scaffold
clients in any language (basically) based on the json available here:

```{r}
sra_get_swagger_json_url()
```



## Accessing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)

We summarize two approaches to accessing TCGA data:

1. `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("TCGAbiolinks")`:
    a. data access through `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("GenomicDataCommons")`
    b. provides data both from the legacy Firehose pipeline used by the TCGA
    publications (alignments based on hg18 and hg19 builds[^11]), and the GDC
    harmonized GRCh38 pipeline[^12].
    c. downloads files from the Genomic Data Commons, and provides conversion to `(Ranged)SummarizedExperiment` where possible
2. `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("curatedTCGAData")`: 
    a. data access through `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ExperimentHub")`
    b. provides data from the legacy Firehose pipeline[^11]
    c. provides individual assays as `(Ranged)SummarizedExperiment` and `RaggedExperiment`, integrates multiple assays within and across cancer types using `MultiAssayExperiment`

[^11]: https://confluence.broadinstitute.org/display/GDAC/FAQ#FAQ-Q%C2%A0Whatreferencegenomebuildareyouusing
[^12]: https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/data-harmonization-and-generation/genomic-data-harmonization-0

### TCGAbiolinks

We demonstrate here generating a `RangedSummarizedExperiment` for RNA-seq data
from adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). For additional information and options, see
the TCGAbiolinks vignettes[^13].

Load packages:
```{r, cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(TCGAbiolinks)
  library(SummarizedExperiment)
})
```

Search for matching data:
```{r, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
library(TCGAbiolinks)
library(SummarizedExperiment)
query <- GDCquery(project = "TCGA-ACC",
                           data.category = "Gene expression",
                           data.type = "Gene expression quantification",
                           platform = "Illumina HiSeq", 
                           file.type  = "normalized_results",
                           experimental.strategy = "RNA-Seq",
                           legacy = TRUE)
```

Download data and convert it to `RangedSummarizedExperiment`:
```{r, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
gdcdir <- file.path("Waldron_PublicData", "GDCdata")
GDCdownload(query, method = "api", files.per.chunk = 10,
            directory = gdcdir)
ACCse <- GDCprepare(query, directory = gdcdir)
ACCse
```

### curatedTCGAData: Curated Data From The Cancer Genome Atlas as MultiAssayExperiment Objects

`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("curatedTCGAData")` does not interface with the Genomic Data Commons, but downloads data from Bioconductor's `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ExperimentHub")`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
    library(curatedTCGAData)
    library(MultiAssayExperiment)
})
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(curatedTCGAData)
library(MultiAssayExperiment)
```


By default, the `curatedTCGAData()` function will only show available datasets,
and not download anything. The arguments are shown here only for demonstration,
the same result is obtained with no arguments:

```{r}
curatedTCGAData(diseaseCode = "*", assays = "*")
```

Check potential files to be downloaded for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC):
```{r}
curatedTCGAData(diseaseCode = "ACC")
```

Actually download the reverse phase protein array (RPPA) and RNA-seq data for ACC
```{r, message=FALSE}
ACCmae <- curatedTCGAData("ACC", c("RPPAArray", "RNASeq2GeneNorm"), 
                          dry.run=FALSE)
ACCmae
```

**Note**. Data will be downloaded the first time the above command is run; subsequent times it will be loaded from local cache.

This object contains `r ncol(MultiAssayExperiment::colData(ACCmae))` columns of clinical, pathological, specimen, and subtypes data in its `colData`, merged from all available data levels (1-4) of the Firehose pipeline:

```{r}
dim(colData(ACCmae))
head(colnames(colData(ACCmae)))
```

See the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("MultiAssayExperiment")` vignette [@Ramos2017-nq] and the *Workflow for Multi-omics Analysis with MultiAssayExperiment* workshop for details on using this object.

#### Subtype information

Some cancer datasets contain associated subtype information within the
clinical datasets provided. This subtype information is included in the
metadata of `colData` of the `MultiAssayExperiment` object. To obtain these
variable names, run the `metadata` function on the `colData` of the object
such as:

```{r}
head(metadata(colData(ACCmae))[["subtypes"]])
```

## recount: Reproducible RNA-seq Analysis Using recount2

The `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("recount")`[@Collado-Torres2017-ww] package provides
uniformly processed `RangedSummarizedExperiment` objects at the gene, exon, or
exon-exon junctions level, the raw counts, the phenotype metadata used, the urls
to sample coverage bigWig files and mean coverage bigWig file, for every study
available. The `RangedSummarizedExperiment` objects can be used for differential
expression analysis. These are also accessible through a web interface [^14].

```{r, results='hide', echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(recount))
```

`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("recount")` provides a search function:
```{r}
library(recount)
project_info <- abstract_search('GSE32465')
```

It is not an ExperimentHub package, so downloading and serializing is slightly more involved in involves two steps: first, download the gene-level RangedSummarizedExperiment data:
```{r}
download_study(project_info$project)
```
followed by loading the data
```{r}
load(file.path(project_info$project, 'rse_gene.Rdata'))
```


[^14]: https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/

## curated*Data packages for standardized cancer transcriptomes

There are focused databases of cancer microarray data for several cancer types, which can be useful for researchers of those cancer types or for methodological development:

* `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("curatedOvarianData")`[@Ganzfried2013-mc]: Clinically Annotated Data for the Ovarian Cancer Transcriptome (data available with additional options through the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("MetaGxOvarian")` package).
* `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("curatedBladderData")`: Clinically Annotated Data for the Bladder Cancer Transcriptome
* `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("curatedCRCData")`: Clinically Annotated Data for the Colorectal Cancer Transcriptome

These provide data from the Gene Expression Omnibus and other sources, but use a formally vocabulary for clinicopathological data and use a common pipeline for preprocessing of microarray data (for Affymetrix, other for other platforms the processed data are provided as processed by original study authors), merging probesets, and mapping to gene symbols. The pipeline is described by @Ganzfried2013-mc.

## Microbiome data

Bioconductor provides curated resources of microbiome data.  Most microbiome data are generated either by targeted amplicon sequencing (usually of variable regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene) or by metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MGX). These two approaches are analyzed by different sequence analysis tools, but downstream statistical and ecological analysis can involve any of the following types of data:

* taxonomic abundance at different levels of the taxonomic hierarchy
* phylogenetic distances and the phylogenetic tree of life
* metabolic potential of the microbiome
* abundance of microbial genes and gene families

A review of types and properties of microbiome data is provided by [@Morgan2012-mq].

### curatedMetagenomicData: Curated and processed metagenomic data through ExperimentHub

```{r, results="hide", echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(curatedMetagenomicData))
```

`curatedMetagenomicData`[@Pasolli2017-gf] provides 6 types of processed data for >30 publicly available whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing datasets (obtained from the Sequence Read Archive):

1. Species-level taxonomic profiles, expressed as relative abundance from kingdom to strain level
2. Presence of unique, clade-specific markers
3. Abundance of unique, clade-specific markers
4. Abundance of gene families
5. Metabolic pathway coverage
6. Metabolic pathway abundance

Types 1-3 are generated by 
[MetaPhlAn2](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/metaphlan2); 4-6 are generated by [HUMAnN2](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann2).

Currently, `curatedMetagenomicData` provides:

* `r nrow(combined_metadata)` samples from `r length(unique(combined_metadata$dataset_name))` datasets, primarily of the human gut but including body sites profiled in the Human Microbiome Project
* Processed data from whole-metagenome shotgun metagenomics, with manually-curated metadata, as integrated and documented Bioconductor 
ExpressionSet objects
* ~80 fields of specimen metadata from original papers, supplementary files, and websites, with manual curation to standardize annotations
* Processing of data through the [MetaPhlAn2](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/metaphlan2) pipeline for taxonomic abundance, and [HUMAnN2](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann2) pipeline for metabolic analysis
* These represent ~100TB of raw sequencing data, but the processed data provided are much smaller.

These datasets are documented in the 
[reference manual](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/manuals/curatedMetagenomicData/man/curatedMetagenomicData.pdf).

This is an `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ExperimentHub")` package, and its main workhorse function is `curatedMetagenomicData()`:

The manually curated metadata for all available samples are provided in a single table `combined_metadata`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(curatedMetagenomicData)
?combined_metadata
View(data.frame(combined_metadata))
```

The main function provides a `list` of `ExpressionSet` objects:
```{r, results="hide"}
oral <- c("BritoIL_2016.metaphlan_bugs_list.oralcavity",
          "Castro-NallarE_2015.metaphlan_bugs_list.oralcavity")
esl <- curatedMetagenomicData(oral, dryrun = FALSE)
```

```{r}
esl
```

These `ExpressionSet` objects can also be converted to `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("phyloseq")` object for ecological analysis and differential abundance analysis using the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("DESeq2")` package, using the `ExpressionSet2phyloseq()` function:
```{r}
ExpressionSet2phyloseq( esl[[1]], phylogenetictree = TRUE)
```

See the documentation of `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("phyloseq")` for more on ecological and differential abundance analysis of the microbiome.

### HMP16SData: 16S rRNA Sequencing Data from the Human Microbiome Project

```{r, results='hide'}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(HMP16SData))
```

`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("HMP16SData")`[@Schiffer2018-qy] is a Bioconductor ExperimentData package of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) 16S rRNA sequencing data. Taxonomic count data files are provided as downloaded from the HMP Data Analysis and Coordination Center from its QIIME pipeline. Processed data is provided as `SummarizedExperiment` class objects via `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ExperimentHub")`. Like other ExperimentHub-based packages, a convenience function does downloading, automatic local caching, and serializing of a Bioconductor data class. This returns taxonomic counts from the V1-3 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene, along with the unrestricted participant data and phylogenetic tree. 
```{r}
V13()
```

This can also be converted to `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("phyloseq")` for ecological and differential abundance analysis; see the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("HMP16SData")` vignette for details.
    
## Pharmacogenomics

Pharmacogenomics holds great promise for the development of biomarkers of drug response and the design of new therapeutic options, which are key challenges in precision medicine. However, such data are scattered and lack standards for efficient access and analysis, consequently preventing the realization of the full potential of pharmacogenomics. To address these issues, we implemented `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("PharmacoGx")`, an easy-to-use, open source package for integrative analysis of multiple pharmacogenomic datasets. ~PharmacoGx` provides a unified framework for downloading and analyzing large pharmacogenomic datasets which are extensively curated to ensure maximum overlap and consistency.

Examples of `PharmacoGx` usage in biomedical research can be found in the following publications:

* [Smirnov et al. PharmacoGx: an R package for analysis of large pharmacogenomic datasets." Bioinformatics (2015): 1244-1246](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/8/1244/1744214/PharmacoGx-an-R-package-for-analysis-of-large).

* [El-Hachem et al., Integrative Cancer Pharmacogenomics to Infer Large-Scale Drug Taxonomy, Cancer Research (2017)](http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/77/11/3057.long)

### Getting started 

Let us first load the `PharmacoGx` library.

```{r loadLibrary10, message=FALSE}
library(PharmacoGx)
```
We can now access large-scale preclinical pharmacogenomic datasets that have been fully curated for ease of use.

### Overview of PharmacoGx datasets (PharmacoSets)

To efficiently store and analyze large pharmacogenomic datasets, we developed the `PharmacoSet` class (also referred to as `PSet`), which acts as a data container storing pharmacological and molecular data along with experimental metadata (detailed structure provided in Supplementary materials). This class enables efficient implementation of curated annotations for cell lines, drug compounds and molecular features, which facilitates comparisons between different datasets stored as `PharmacoSet` objects.

We have made the PharmacoSet objects of the curated datasets available for download using functions provided in the package. A table of available PharmacoSet objects can be obtained by using the *availablePSets* function. Any of the PharmacoSets in the table can then be downloaded by calling *downloadPSet*, which saves the datasets into a directory of the users choice, and returns the data into the R session.

To get a list of all the available `PharmacoSets` in PharmacoGx, we can use the availablePSets` function, which returns a table providing key information for each dataset.

```{r availablePSets, message=FALSE}
availablePSets(saveDir=file.path(".", "Waldron_PublicData"))
```
There are currently 11 datasets available in PharmacoGx, including 8 sensitivity datasets and 3 perturbation datasets (see below).


#### Drug Sensitivity Datasets

Drug sensitivity datasets refer to pharmacogenomic data where cancer cells are molecularly profiled at baseline (before drug treatment), and the effect of drug treatment on cell viability is measured using a pharmacological assay (e.g., Cell Titer-Glo). These datasets can be used for biomarker discovery by correlating the molecular features of cancer cells to their response to drugs of interest.

```{r availableSensitivityPSets, message=FALSE}
psets <- availablePSets(saveDir=file.path(".", "Waldron_PublicData"))
psets[psets[ , "Dataset.Type"] == "sensitivity", ]
```
Notably, the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer [GDSC](https://www.cancerrxgene.org/) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia [CCLE](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle) are large drug sensitivity datasets published in seminal studies in Nature, [Garnett et al., https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11005, Nature (2012)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11005) and [Barretina et al., The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity, Nature (2012)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11003), respectively.


#### Drug Perturbation Datasets

Drug perturbation datasets refer to pharmacogenomic data where gene expression profiles are measured before and after short-term (e.g., 6h) drug treatment to identify genes that are up- and down-regulated due to the drug treatment. These datasets can be to classify drug (drug taxonomy), infer their mechanism of action, or find drugs with similar effects (drug repurposing).

[Schematic view of drug perturbation datasets](Waldron_PublicData/Drug_perturbation.png)

```{r availablePerturbationPSets, message=FALSE}
psets <- availablePSets(saveDir=file.path(".", "Waldron_PublicData"))
psets[psets[ , "Dataset.Type"] == "perturbation", ]
```
Large drug perturbation data have been generated within the Connectivity Map Project [CAMP](https://clue.io/cmap), with CMAPv2 and CMAPv3 available from `PharmacoGx`, published in [Lamb et al., The Connectivity Map: Using Gene-Expression Signatures to Connect Small Molecules, Genes, and Disease, Science (2006)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5795/1929) and [Subramanian et al., A Next Generation Connectivity Map: L1000 Platform and the First 1,000,000 Profiles, Cell (2017)](https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(17)31309-0), respectively.
 
### Exploring drug sensitivity datasets

The [Biomarker discovery from large pharmacogenomics datasets](https://bioconductor.github.io/BiocWorkshops/biomarker-discovery-from-large-pharmacogenomics-datasets.html) workshop demonstrates analyses of `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("PharmacoGx")` data.
