## Overview

### Description

This workshop is intended for those with little or no experience using
_R_ or _Bioconductor_. In the first portion of the workshop, we will
explore the basics of using _RStudio_, essential _R_ data types,
composing short scripts and using functions, and installing and using
packages that extend base _R_ functionality. The second portion of the
workshop orients participants to the _Bioconductor_ collection of _R_
packages for analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic
data. We will describe how to discover, install, and learn to use
_Bioconductor_ packages, and will explore some of the unique ways in
which _Bioconductor_ represents genomic data. The workshop will
primarily be instructor-led live demos, with participants following
along in their own _RStudio_ sessions.

### Pre-requisites

This workshop is meant to be introductory, and has no pre-requisites.

Participants will maximize benefit from the workshop by pursuing
elementary instructions for using _R_, such as the
[introductory course][] from DataCamp.

## Introduction to _R_

### _RStudio_ orientation

### Very basics

_R_ works by typing into the console. A very simple example is to add the numbers 1 and 2.

```{r}
1 + 2
```

_R_ works best on _vectors_, and we can construct vectors 'by hand' using the function `c()` (perhaps for _c_oncatenate). Here is a vector of the numbers 1, 3, and 5.

```{r}
c(1, 3, 5)
```

_R_ has many shortcuts. A very commonly used shortcut is to create a vector representing a sequence of numbers using `:`. For instance, here is a vector representing the numbers 1 through 5.


```{r}
1:5
```

It would be pretty tedious to continually have to enter vectors by hand. _R_ allows objects such as the vector returned by `c()` to be assigned to variables. The variables can then be referenced at subsequent points in the script.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 3, 5)
x
```

Since _R_ knows about vectors, it can be very easy to transform all elements of the vector, e.g., taking the `log()` of `x`;

```{r}
log(x)
```

The return value of `log(x)` is itself a vector, and can be assigned to another variable.

```{r}
y <- log(x)
y
```

### Data input and manipulation

**Read data files into _R_ `data.frame` objects**. We start by reading a simple file into _R_. The file is a 'csv' (comma-separated value) file that could have been exported from a spreadsheet. The first few lines of the file include:

```
"Sample","sex","age","mol.biol"
"01005","M",53,"BCR/ABL"
"01010","M",19,"NEG"
"03002","F",52,"BCR/ABL"
"04006","M",38,"ALL1/AF4"
"04007","M",57,"NEG"
```

The file describes samples used in a classic microarray experiment. It consists of four columns:

- `Sample`: a unique identifier
- `sex`: the sex of each patient
- `age`: the age of each patient
- `mol.biol`: cytological characterization of each patient, e.g.,
  `"BCR/ABL"` indicates presence of the classic BCR/ABL translocation,
  while `"NEG"` indicates no special cytological information.

We start by asking are to find the _path_ to the file, using a function `file.choose()`. This will open a dialog box, and we will navigate to the location of a file named `"ALL-phenoData.csv"`. Print the value of `fname` to view the path that you choose.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fname <- file.choose()
fname
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
fname <- "./100_Morgan_RBiocForAll/ALL-phenoData.csv"
```

Confirm that the file exists using the `file.exists()` command.

```{r}
file.exists(fname)
```

Read the data from the csv file using `read.csv()`; assign the input to a variable called `pdata`.

```{r}
pdata <- read.csv(fname)
```

**Viewing the `data.frame`**

We could print the entire data frame to the screen using

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pdata
```

but a smarter way to explore the data is to ask about its dimensions (rows and columns) using `dim()`, to look at the `head()` and `tail()` of the data, and to ask _R_ for a brief `summary()`.

```{r}
dim(pdata)   # 128 rows x 4 columns
head(pdata)  # first six rows
tail(pdata)  # last six rows
summary(pdata)
```

The `age` element of `pdata` is a vector of integers and the summary provides a quantitative description of the data. Some values are missing, and these have the special value `NA`. 

The `sex` and `mol.biol` vectors are _factors_. The `sex` variable has two _levels_ (`M`, `F`) while the `mol.biol` vector has 6 levels. A factor is a statistical concept central to describing data; the levels describe the universe of possible values that the variable can take.

`Sample` is also a `factor`, but it should probably be considered a `character` vector used to identify each sample; we clean this up in just a minute.

In addition to `summary()`, it can be helpful to use `class()` to look at the class of each object or column, e.g.,

```{r}
class(fname)
class(pdata)
```

**Reading data, round two**

We noted that `Sample` has been read by _R_ as a factor. Consult the (complicated!) help page for `read.csv()` and try to understand how to use `colClasses` to specify how each column of data should be input.

To navigate to the help page, use

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?read.csv
```

Focus on the `colClasses` argument. It is a vector that describes the class each column should be interpretted as. We'd like to read the columns as character, factor, integer, factor. Start by creating a vector of desired values

```{r}
c("character", "factor", "integer", "factor")
```

Then  add another argument to our use of `read.csv()`, specifying the desired column classes as this vector.

```{r}
pdata <- read.csv(
    fname,
    colClasses = c("character", "factor", "integer", "factor")
)
summary(pdata)
```

**Subsetting**

A basic operation in _R_ is to subset data. A `data.frame` is a two-dimensional object, so it is subset by specifying the desired rows and columns. Several different ways of specifying rows and colums are possible. Row selection often involves numeric vectors, logical vectors, and character vectors (selecting the rows with the corresponding `rownames()`). Column selection is most often with a character vector, but can also be numeric.

```{r}
pdata[1:5, c("sex", "mol.biol")]
pdata[1:5, c(2, 3)]
```

Omitting either the row or column index selects all rows or columns

```{r}
pdata[1:5, ]
```

The subset operator `[` generally returns the same type of object as being subset, e.g., above all return values are `data.frame` objects. It is sometimes desirable to select a single column as a vector. This can be done using `$` or `[[`; note that some values are `NA`, indicating that the patient's age is "not available".

```{r}
pdata$age
pdata[["age"]]
```

We can use `class()` to determine the type of each column

```{r}
class(pdata$age)
```

as well as other functions to manipulate or summarize the data. What do each of the following lines do?

```{r}
table(pdata$mol.biol)
table(is.na(pdata$age))
levels(pdata$sex)
```

**Basic data manipulations**

We've seen (e.g., `log()`, above) that numeric vectors can be transformed by mathematical functions. Similar functions are available for other data types. A very common scenario is to create logical vectors that are then used to subset objects. Here we compare each element of the `sex` column to `"F"`. The result indicates which rows in the `pdata` correspond to indivdudals with sex `"F"`.

```{r}
pdata$sex == "F"
```

A more elaborate example identifies rows corresponding to females greater than 50 years of age. Note that some comparisons are `NA`; why is that?

```{r}
(pdata$sex == "F") & (pdata$age > 50)
```

Another elaborate comparison is `%in%`, which asks whether each element in the vector on the left-hand side of `%in%` is contained in the set of values on the right-hand side, for example, which elements of the `pdata$mol.biol` column are in the set `"BCR/ABL"` or `"NEG"`?

```{r}
table( pdata$mol.biol )
pdata$mol.biol %in% c("BCR/ABL", "NEG")
```

The `subset()` function can be used to perform the subset, e.g., selecting all records of females older than 50

```{r}
subset(pdata, sex == "F" & age > 50)
```
    
The return value of `subset()` can be assigned to a variable, so the below creates a subset of `pdata` corresponding to indivdiuals whose `mol.biol` is either `"BCR/ABL"` or `"NEG"`; the result is assigned to a variable `bcrabl`.

```{r}
bcrabl <- subset(pdata, mol.biol %in% c("BCR/ABL", "NEG"))
dim( bcrabl )
```

Here's a tabular summary of the levels of the `mol.biol` factor in `bcrabl`

```{r}
table(bcrabl$mol.biol)
```

Note that the factor includes levels that are not actually present in the subset. For our work below, we'd like to remove the unused levels. This can be done by calling the `factor()` function
    
```{r}
factor(bcrabl$mol.biol)
```
    
We can then update the `mol.biol` column of `bcrabl` by assigning new values to it with `<-`.

```{r}
bcrabl$mol.biol <- factor(bcrabl$mol.biol)
table(bcrabl$mol.biol)
```

**Exploratory data analysis**

A very useful concept in _R_ is the `formula`. This is specified in a form like `lhs ~ rhs`. The left-hand side is typically a response (dependent) variable, and the right-hand side a description of the independent variables that one is interested in. I 'say' a formula like `age ~ mol.biol` as "age as a function of mol.biol".

To get a sense of the use of formulas in _R_, and the ease with which one can explore data, use the `boxplot()` function to visualize the relationship between age as a function of molecular biology.

```{r}
boxplot(age ~ mol.biol, bcrabl)
```

Consult the help page `?boxplot` to figure out how to add "Age" as the y-axis label.

The boxplot suggests that in our sample individuals with BCR/ABL are on average older than individuals classified as NEG. Confirm this using `t.test()`.

```{r}
t.test(age ~ mol.biol, bcrabl)
```

It might be surprising that the `df` (degrees of freedom) are not a round number, but 68.592. This is because by default _R_ performs a t-test that allows for variances to differ between groups. Consult the `?t.test` help page to figure out to perform a simpler form of the t-test, where variances are equal.

### Writing _R_ scripts

### Using packages

_R_ functions are made available in _packages_. All the functions that we have used so far are implemented in packages that are distributed with _R_. There are actually more than 15,000 _R_ packages available for a wide variety of purposes. The general challenge we explore here is how to discover, install, and use one of these packages.

**Discover**

The most common place to find _R_ packages in on the comprehensive _R_ archive network, CRAN.

Visit CRAN at [https://cran.r-project.org][], click on the 'Packages' link, and the table of available packages sorted by name. Find the [ggplot2][] package and peruse the information you are presented with. What does this package do?

The large number of _R_ packages can make finding the 'best' packages for a particular purpose difficult to identify. From [https://cran.r-project.org][], click on the 'Task Views' link and explore a topic interesting to you.

[https://cran.r-project.org]: https://cran.r-project.org

**Install (once only per _R_ installation)**

One useful packages have been identified, they need to be installed into _R_. This only needs to be done once per _R_ installation. The following installs the [ggplot2][] and [tibble][] packages; you DO NOT need to do this command because [ggplot2][] is already installed on your AMI.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## No need to do this...
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "tibble"))
```

[tibble]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=tibble

**Use**

Packages that are installed on your system are not available for use until they are attached to the current _R_ session. Use `library()` to attach the [ggplot2][] package.

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
```

Look up help on `?ggplot`. Peruse especially the examples at the bottom of the help page. The idea is that one identifies the data set to be used, and the variables with the data to be used as the x and y 'aesthetics'

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(brcabl, aes(x = mol.biol, y = age))
```

One then adds 'geoms' to the plot, for instance the boxplot geom

```{r}
ggplot(bcrabl, aes(x = mol.biol, y = age)) + geom_boxplot()
```

Use `xlab()` and `ylab()` to enhance the plot with more meaning x and y labels; see the help page `?xlab`, especially the example section, for hints on how to modify the graph.

The grammar of graphics implemented by [ggplot2][] is a very powerful and expressive system for producing appealing visualizations, and is widely used in the _R_ community.

## Introduction to _Bioconductor_

_Bioconductor_ is a collection of more than 1,500 packages for the statistical analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. Originally developed for microarrays, _Bioconductor_ packages are now used in a wide range of analyses, including bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, ChIP seq, copy number analysis, microarray methylation and classic expression analysis, flow cytometry, and many other domains. 

This section of the workshop introduces the essential of _Bioconductor_ package discovery, installation, and use.

### Discovering, installing, and learning how to use _Bioconductor_ packages

**Discovery**

The web site at https://bioconductor.org contains descriptions of all _Bioconductor_ packages, as well as essential reference material for all levels of user.

Packages available in _Bioconductor_ are summarized at [https://bioconductor.org/packages][], also linked from the front page of the web site. The widget on the left summarizes four distinct types of _Bioconductor_ packages

- 'Software' packages implement particular analyses or other functionality, e.g., querying web-based resources or importing common file formats to _Bioconductor_ objects.

- 'Annotation' packages contain data that can be helpful in placing analysis results in context, for example: mapping between gene symbols such as "BRCA1" and Ensembl or Entrez gene identifiers; classifying genes in terms of gene ontology; describing the genomic coordinates of exons, transcripts, and genes; and representing whole genome sequences of common organisms.

- 'Experiment data' packages contain highly curated data sets that can be useful for learning and teaching (e.g., the [airway][] package and data set used in the [DESeq2][] package for the analysis of bulk RNA-seq differential expression) or placing results in context (e.g., the [curatedTCGAData][] package for conveniently accessing TCGA data in a way that allows very smooth integeration into _Bioconductor_ analyses).

- 'Workflow' packages that summarize common work flows, e.g., [simpleSingleCell][] for single-cell RNA-seq expression analysis.

[airway]: https://bioconductor.org/packages/airway
[curatedTCGAData]: https://bioconductor.org/packages/curatedTCGAData
[simpleSingleCell]: https://bioconductor.org/packages/simpleSingleCell

**Installation**

Like CRAN packages, _Bioconductor_ packages need to be installed only once per _R_ installation, and then attached to each session where they are going to be used.

_Bioconductor_ packages are installed slightly differently from CRAN packages. The first step is to install the [BiocManager][] package from CRAN.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!"BiocManager" %in% rownames(intalled.packages()))
    install.packages("BiocManager", repos="https://cran.r-project.org")
```

The next step is to install the desired _Bioconductor_ packages. The syntax to install the [rtracklayer][] and [GenomicRanges][] packages is

```{r, eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install(c("rtracklayer", "GenomicRanges"))
```

_Bioconductor_ packages tend to depend on one another quite alot, so it is important that the correct versions of all packages are installed. Validate your installation (not necessary during the course) with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::valid()
```

A convenient function in [BiocManager][] is `available()`, which accepts a regular expression to find matching packages. The following finds all 'TxDb' packages (describing exon, transcript, and gene coordinates) for _Homo sapiens_.

```{r}
BiocManager::available("TxDb.Hsapiens")
```

[BiocManager]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=BiocManager

**Learning and support**

Each package is linked to a 'landing page', e.g., [DESeq2][] that contains a description of the package, authors, perhaps literature citations where the software is described, and installation instructions.

An important part of _Bioconductor_ packages are 'vignettes' which describe how the package is to be used. Vignettes are linked from package landing pages, and are available from within _R_ using

```{r, eval = FALSE}
browseVignettes("simpleSingleCell")
```

Users can get support on using packages at https://support.bioconductor.org, a question-and-answer style forum where response usually come quickly and often from very knowledgable users or the package developer. There are many additional sources of support, including [course material][] linked from the home page.

### Working with Genomic Ranges

This section introduces two useful packages for general-purpose work on genomic coordinates. The [rtracklayer][] package provides the `import()` function to read many types of genomic files (e.g., BED, GTF, VCF, FASTA) into _Bioconductor_ objects. The [GenomicRanges][] package provides functions for manipulating genomic ranges, i.e., descriptions of exons, genes, ChIP peaks, called variants, ... as coordinates in genome space.

Start by attaching the [rtracklayer][] and [GenomicRanges][] packages to our session.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library("rtracklayer")
library("GenomicRanges")
```

**Importing data**

We'll read in a BED file derived from the UCSC genome browser. The file contains the coordinates of all CpG islands in the human genome, and is described at the [UCSC table browser][]. Here are the first few lines of the file, giving the chromosme, start and end coordinates, and identifier of each CpG island.

[UCSC table browser]: https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?hgsid=578954849_wF1QP81SIHdfr8b0kmZUOcsZcHYr&clade=mammal&org=Human&db=hg38&hgta_group=regulation&hgta_track=knownGene&hgta_table=0&hgta_regionType=genome&position=chr9%3A133252000-133280861&hgta_outputType=primaryTable&hgta_outFileName=

```
chr1	155188536	155192004	CpG:_361
chr1	2226773	2229734	CpG:_366
chr1	36306229	36307408	CpG:_110
chr1	47708822	47710847	CpG:_164
chr1	53737729	53739637	CpG:_221
chr1	144179071	144179313	CpG:_20
```

Use `file.choose()` to find the file

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fname <- file.choose()   # CpGislands.Hsapiens.hg38.UCSC.bed
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
fname <- "100_Morgan_RBiocForAll/CpGislands.Hsapiens.hg38.UCSC.bed"
```

```{r}
fname
file.exists(fname)
```

Then use `import()` from [rtracklayer][] to read the data into _R_. The end result is a `GenomicRanges` object describing each CpG island.

```{r}
cpg <- import(fname)
cpg
```

Closely compare the coordinates of the first few ranges from the file with the first few ranges in the _Bioconductor_ representation. The [BED format][] specification says that coordinates are 0-based, and intervals are half-open (the 'start' coordinate is in the range, the 'end' coordinate is immediately after the range; this makes some computations easy). _Bioconductor_'s convention is that coordinates are 1-based and closed (i.e., both start and end coordinates are included in the range). [rtracklayer][]'s `import()` function has adjusted coordinates to follow _Bioconductor_ conventions.

[BED format]: https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1

**Working with genomic ranges**

For convenience and to illustrate functionality, let's work only with the 'standard' chromosomes 1 - 22 autosomal, X, and Y chromosomes. Look up the help page `?keepStandardChromosomes` for an explanation of `pruning.mode=`.

```{r}
cpg <- keepStandardChromosomes(cpg, pruning.mode = "coarse")
cpg
```

There are two parts to a `GenomicRanges` object. The `seqnames` (chromosomes, in the present case), start and end coordinates, and strand are _required_. Additional elements such as `name` in the current example are optional.
Required components are accessed by functions such as `start()`, `end()` and `width()`. Optional components can be accessed using the `$` notation.

```{r}
head( start(cpg) )
head( cpg$name )
```

Use the `width()` accessor function to extract a vector of widths of each CpG island. Transform the values using `log10()`, and visualize the distribution using `hist()`.

```{r}
hist(log10(width(cpg)))
```

Use `subset()` to select the CpG islands on chromosomes 1 and 2.

```{r}
subset(cpg, seqnames %in% c("chr1", "chr2"))
```

**Genomic annotations**

Earlier we mentioned 'Annotation data' packages. An example is the TxDb.* family of packages. These packages contain information on the genomic coordinates of exons, genes, transcripts, etc. Attach the TxDb package corresponding to the _Homo sapiens_ hg38 genome build using the UCSC 'knownGene' track.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library("TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene")
```

Extract the coordinates of all transcripts

```{r}
tx <- transcripts(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene)
tx
```

Keep only the standard chromosomes, to work smoothly with our `cpg` object.

```{r}
tx <- keepStandardChromosomes(tx, pruning.mode="coarse")
tx
```

**Overlaps**

A very useful operation is to count overlaps in two distinct genomic ranges objects. The following counts the number of CpG islands that overlap each transcript. Related functions include `findOverlaps()`, `nearest()`, `precede()`, and `follow()`.

```{r}
olaps <- countOverlaps(tx, cpg)
length(olaps)     # 1 count per transcript
table(olaps)
```

Calculations such as `countOverlaps()` can be added to the `GRanges` object, tightly coupling derived data with the original annotation.

```{r}
tx$cpgOverlaps <- countOverlaps(tx, cpg)
tx
```

It is then possible to perform coordinated actions, e.g., subsetting the `GRanges` objects for transcripts satisfying particular conditions, in a coordinated fashion where the software does all the book-keeping to makes sure the correct ranges are selected.

```{r}
subset(tx, cpgOverlaps > 10)
````

Can you think of other situations where one might calculate derived values and couple these with `GRanges` or similar objects?

### Working with summarized experimental data

This section introduces another broadly useful package and data structure, the [SummarizedExperiment][] package and `SummarizedExperiment` object. 

![](100_Morgan_RBiocForAll/SummarizedExperiment.png)

The `SummarizedExperiment` object has matrix-like properties -- it has two dimensions and can be subset by 'rows' and 'columns'. The `assay()` data of a `SummarizedExperiment` experiment contains one or more matrix-like objects where rows represent features of interest (e.g., genes), columns represent samples, and elements of the matrix represent results of a genomic assay (e.g., counts of reads overlaps genes in each sample of an bulk RNA-seq differential expression assay.

**Object construction**

The `SummarizedExperiment` coordinates assays with (optional) descriptions of rows and columns. We start by reading in a simple `data.frame` describing 8 samples from an RNASeq experiment looking at dexamethasone treatment across 4 human smooth muscle cell lines; use `browseVignettes("airway")` for a more complete description of the experiment and data processing. Read the column data in using `file.choose()` and `read.csv()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fname <- file.choose()  # airway_colData.csv
fname
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fname <- "100_Morgan_RBiocForAll/airway_colData.csv"
```
We want the first column the the data to be treated as row names (sample identifiers) in the `data.frame`, so `read.csv()` has an extra argument to indicate this.

```{r}
colData <- read.csv(fname, row.names = 1)
colData
```

The data are from the Short Read Archive, and the row names, `SampleName`, `Run`, `Experiment`, `Sampel`, and `BioSample` columns are classifications from the archive. Additional columns include:

- `cell`: the cell line used. There are four cell lines.
- `dex`: whether the sample was untreated, or treated with dexamethasone.
- `albut`: a second treatment, which we ignore
- `avgLength`: the sample-specific average length of the RNAseq reads estimated in the experiment.

**Assay data**

Now import the assay data from the file "airway_counts.csv"

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fname <- file.choose()  # airway_counts.csv
fname
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fname <- "100_Morgan_RBiocForAll/airway_counts.csv"
```

```{r}
counts <- read.csv(fname, row.names=1)
```

Although the data are read as a `data.frame`, all columns are of the same type (integer-valued) and represent the same attribute; the data is really a `matrix` rather than `data.frame`, so we coerce to matrix using `as.matrix()`.

```{r}
counts <- as.matrix(counts)
```

We see the dimensions and first few rows of the counts matrix

```{r}
dim(counts)
head(counts)
```

It's interesting to think about what the counts mean -- for ENSG00000000003, sample SRR1039508 had 679 reads that overlapped this gene, sample SRR1039509 had 448 reads, etc. Notice that for this gene there seems to be a consistent pattern -- within a cell line, the read counts in the untreated group are always larger than the read counts for the treated group. This and other basic observations from 'looking at' the data motivate many steps in a rigorous RNASeq differential expression analysis.

**Creating a `SummarizedExperiment` object**

We saw earlier that there was considerable value in tightly coupling the count of CpG islands overlapping each transcript with the `GRanges` describing the transcripts. We can anticipate that close coupling of the column data with the assay data will have similar benefits, e.g., reducing the chances of bookkeeping errors as we work with our data.

Attach the [SummarizedExperiment][] library to our _R_ session.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library("SummarizedExperiment")
```

Use the `SummarizedExperiment()` function to coordinate the assay and column data; this function uses row and column names to make sure the correct assay columns are desribed by the correct column data rows.

```{r}
se <- SummarizedExperiment(assay = counts, colData = colData)
se
```

It is straight-forward to use `subset()` on `SummarizedExperiment` to create subsets of the data in a coordinated way. Remember that a `SummarizedExperiment` is conceptually two-dimensional (matrix-like), and in the example below we are subsetting on the second dimension.

```{r}
subset(se, , dex == "trt")
```

As with `GRanges`, there are accessors that extract data from the `SummarizedExperiment`. For instance, we can use `assay()` to extract the count matrix, and `colSums()` to calculate the library size (total number of reads overlapping genes in each sample).

```{r}
colSums(assay(se))
```

Note that library sizes differ by a factor of 2 from largest to smallest; how would this influence the interpretation of counts in individual cells of the assay data?

As with `GRanges`, it might be useful to remember important computations in a way that is robust, e.g., 

```{r}
se$lib.size <- colSums(assay(se))
colData(se)
```

### Down-stream analysis

In this final section we quickly hint at down-stream analysis, and the way in which skills learned in working with _Bioconductor_ objects in one package translate to working with objects in other packages.

We start by loading the [DESeq2][] package, a very popular facility for analysing bulk RNAseq differential experssion data.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library("DESeq2")
```

The package requires count data like that in the `SummarizedExperiment` we have been working with, in addition to a `formula` describing the experimental design. Some of the observations above suggest that we should include cell line as a covariate, and dexamethazone treatment as the main factor that we are interested in.

```{r}
dds <- DESeqDataSet(se, design = ~ cell + dex)
dds
```

The `dds` object can be manipulated very much like a `SummarizedExperiment`.

The essention DESeq work flow is summarized by a single function call, which performs advanced statistical analysis on the data in the `dds` object.

```{r}
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

A table summarizing measures of differential expression can be extracted from the object, and visualized or manipulated using commands we learned earlier today.

```{r}
results(dds)
```
